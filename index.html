      <h2>Personal Info</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Faiyaaz Ismail</strong>, currently living in Dhaka. I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Brac university, passionate about all things tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a special interest in <strong>web development</strong> — building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.
        I enjoy working with technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to bring ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who can design, build, and deploy meaningful projects that help people and make a positive impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I love exploring new technologies, solving challenges, and continuously learning to improve my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favourite quote is:
        <em>"The man who loves walking will walk further than the man who loves the destination."</em>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I’m <strong>Faiyaaz Ismail</strong>, a Computer Science student living in Dhaka with a big dream of becoming a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first got interested in software engineering when I helped a fellow student with coding on a project. That experience showed me how powerful and rewarding it is to solve people's problems through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about building web applications that not only work but feel smooth and intuitive to use. Outside of coding, you’ll often find me playing football, traveling to explore new places, and meeting people from different backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning new technologies and turning creative ideas into real, user-friendly projects. My goal is simple: to keep growing, keep building, and create software that truly helps people.
      </p>
